Warm-up: Start with 5-10 minutes of light cardio to get your blood flowing and prepare your muscles for exercise. You can use a treadmill, stationary bike, or elliptical machine.

Stretching: Take 5-10 minutes to stretch your major muscle groups, such as your legs, back, chest, and arms. This will improve your flexibility and reduce your risk of injury.

Resistance training: Choose 3-4 exercises that target your major muscle groups, such as squats, lunges, bench press, and pull-ups.
Perform 3 sets of 8-12 reps for each exercise, using a weight that challenges you but allows you to maintain proper form.

Cardiovascular training: Choose a form of cardio that you enjoy, such as running, cycling, or swimming. Perform 20-30 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio, aiming to maintain a heart rate of 60-80% of your maximum heart rate.

Cool-down: Finish your workout with 5-10 minutes of light cardio and stretching. This will help to gradually reduce your heart rate and prevent blood pooling in your muscles.
